## Port Scanner

This is a simple Python port scanner that allows you to scan ports on a target host. You can specify a range of ports to scan or provide a list of custom ports.

## Installation

The module "socket" and "threading" is one of Python's standard libraries and comes with the Python installation. Therefore it does not need to be downloaded or installed separately.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `port_scanner.py` file.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the scanner by executing the following command:

python port_scanner.py

4. Follow the prompts to enter the target IP address and the port range or custom ports you want to scan.

- To scan a range of ports, use the format: `start_port-end_port` (e.g., `20-80`).
- To scan custom ports, separate them with commas (e.g., `8080,9090,8888`).

5. The scanner will start scanning the specified ports and display the results.
